Package: ChromatinCompare
Title: Compare and analyze chromatin segmentation (ChromHMM, Segway, etc.) differences
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("David", "McGaughey", email = "mcgaugheyd@mail.nih.gov", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: ChromatinCompare takes, as input, bed files of chromatin 
  segmentation from programs like ChromHMM (http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/) 
  and Segway (http://segway.hoffmanlab.org) and provides tools to quickly 
  visualize and compare differences between segmentation files at 
  user-selectable level (e.g. gene body, exons only, promoter regions). 
  ChromDiff (http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromDiff/) provides similar functionality, 
  but requires a large set of carefully formatted inputs and only works at the
  gene level. 
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
